# Winter Chan

This is a repo for the
[Snowcodes](https://www.snowcodes.org/)
Hackathon. It includes a Discord bot written
in Javascript with Node.js engine and powered
by my custom made API library for Discord.

The library is yet not Open Source, neither it is ready,
but it has a name "nullcord" and promises to be
lightweight, fast and easy to use.

The Discord bot is called "Winter Chan".
It is winter themed and will probably
contain a mini game and/or maybe something else.

Working fast because of my tight schedule.
